      Thanks to <a href="http://common-lisp.net">common-lisp.net</a> for
      web site and mailing list hosting.  Please note the repository
      on <a href="https://github.com/bluelisp/zip">github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uses <a href="http://www.xach.com/lisp/salza2/">salza2</a> for
      compression, <a
      href="http://www.weitz.de/flexi-streams/">flexi-streams</a> for external
      format support, <a
      href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-plus-ssl/#trivial-gray-streams">trivial-gray-streams</a>
      for gray streams portability, and includes <a
      href="http://opensource.franz.com/deflate/">inflate.cl</a>
      for decompression.
    </p>

    <h2>Recent changes</h2>
    <p>
      2015: Move to github, and backport of changes from downstream fork
      (Thanks to Tomas Hlavaty.)
    <p>
    <p>
      2006 -- 2011: During this time a fork occurred.  The
      common-lisp.net version of the library received little attention,
      except that it was ported to ASDF2.  (Thanks to Faré Rideau.)
    <p>
    <p>
      2006: Fixed the gray stream port, including a data corruption bug
      that was in CVS for some time.  (Thanks to Kevin Reid and others.)
      Switched to flexi-stream external-format functions for
      portability.  Uses trivial-gray-streams now.  Allegro 8.0 fix
      (thanks to Edi Weitz).  Comment support (thanks to Surendra
      Singhi).  Incompatible change: Don't bind
      <tt>*locale*</tt> on Allegro anymore.
    <p>
    </p>
      2005-04-05: ACL fixes (thank to Edi Weitz).  Lispworks port
      (thanks to Sean Ross).  Store <tt>file-write-date</tt> (also fixes
      FilZip compatibility).
    </p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Quicklisp (if in doubt,
	this is a good way to get started):<br/>
	<pre>(ql:quickload :zip)</pre></li>
      <li>From github: <pre>git clone https://github.com/bluelisp/zip</pre></li>
      <li>Using clbuild2 from github: <pre>clbuild install-from-upstream zip</pre> &#45;&#45; For the one or two clbuild users out there</li>
      <li>Using clbuild2 via QuickLisp: <pre>clbuild quickload zip</pre> &#45;&#45; Ditto</li>
      <li>Tarball releases &#45;&#45; Unfortunately we are not currently offering a release tarball for download.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Portability</h2>
    <p>
      Needs gray streams.  The original version had separate support
      out-of-the-box on SBCL, Lispworks, and ACL.  The fork briefly
      introduced some features specific to simple-stream / ACL.  We
      believe the library to currently be portable to most popular
      Common Lisp implementations, but patches are welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>ZIP-file reading</h2>
    <p>
      Zip archives are represented as opaque handles.  Entries of the
      zip-file are named by strings and represented as objects, too.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function OPEN-ZIPFILE (pathname) => zipfile</div>
    <p>
      Open .zip-file <tt>pathname</tt> for reading and return a handle for it.
    </p>
    <div class="def">Function CLOSE-ZIPFILE (zipfile)</div>
    <p>
      Close the file handle.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Macro WITH-ZIPFILE ((var pathname) &body body) => result of body</div>
    <p>
      Bind <tt>var</tt> to the result of <tt>open-zipfile</tt>, evaluate
      body as an implicit progn and call <tt>close-zipfile</tt> before
      exiting.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function GET-ZIPFILE-ENTRY (name zipfile) => zipfile-entry</div>
    <p>Return an entry handle for the file called <tt>name</tt>.</p>
    <div class="def">Function ZIPFILE-ENTRIES (zipfile) => hash-table</div>
    <p>
      Return a hash-table mapping filenames to entry handles for all
      files contained in the zip archive.
    </p>
    <div class="def">Macro DO-ZIPFILE-ENTRIES ((name-var entry-var zipfile) &body body) => nil</div>
    <p>
      Map over all entries in <tt>zipfile</tt> binding <tt>name-var</tt>
      and <tt>entry-var</tt> to each file name and entry handle in
      turn.  Establish implicit block named <tt>nil</tt> around the
      loop.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function ZIPFILE-ENTRY-NAME (zipfile-entry) => string</div>
    <p>Return an entry's file name as a string.</p>
    <div class="def">Function ZIPFILE-ENTRY-CONTENTS (entry &optional
    stream) => see below</div>
    <p>
      If <tt>stream</tt> is given, extract <tt>entry</tt> to the
      <tt>(unsigned-byte 8)</tt> stream given as the argument.
      Otherwise, return the entry contents as an <tt>(unsigned-byte
      8)</tt> vector.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function UNZIP (pathname target-directory &key if-exists verbose) => nil</div>
    <p>
      Extract all entries from the zip archive at <tt>pathname</tt> into
      <tt>target-directory</tt>.  <tt>if-exists</tt> as for <a
      href="http://www.xach.com/clhs.php?open">cl:open</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>ZIP-file writing</h2>
    <p>
      <tt>zipwriter</tt>s are handles used to create zip archives. They
      are distinct from the zip handles used for reading.
    </p>
    <div class="def">Macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-ZIPFILE ((var pathname &key if-exists) &body body)</div>
    <p>
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function WRITE-ZIPENTRY (zipwriter name data &key file-write-date)</div>
    <p>
      Append a new entry called <tt>name</tt> to <tt>zipwriter</tt>.
      Read data from <tt>(unsigned-byte 8)</tt> stream <tt>data</tt>
      until EOF and compress it into "deflate"-format.
      Use <tt>file-write-date</tt> as the entry's date and time.
      Default to <tt>(file-write-date data)</tt>, use 1980-01-01T00:00
      if <tt>nil</tt>.
    </p>

    <div class="def">Function ZIP (pathname source-directory &key if-exists)</div>
    <p>
      Compress all files in <tt>source-directory</tt> recursively into a
      new zip archive at <tt>pathname</tt>.  Note that entry file names
      will not contain the name <tt>source-directory</tt>.
